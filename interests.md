    <h2>About My Interests</h2>
    <div class="interest-description">
      <h3>🏀 Basketball</h3>
      <p>I enjoy playing basketball as it helps me stay active and develop teamwork skills. The sport teaches me about strategy, coordination, and the importance of practice and persistence.</p>

    <div class="interest-description">
      <h3>⛵ Sailing</h3>
      <p>Sailing represents my love for adventure and the sea. It's a sport that requires patience, understanding of weather patterns, and the ability to work with natural elements.</p>

    <div class="interest-description">
      <h3>🎵 Music</h3>
      <p>Music is my creative outlet and a way to relax. I appreciate various genres and find that music helps me focus during work and provides inspiration for my projects. My favourite singers are Talor Swift and Ed Sheeran.</p>

    <div class="interest-description">
      <h3>💻 Coding Contest</h3>
      <p>I have no OI experience during my high school and I learnt all by myself and was fortunate to have my best two teammates who had no prior experience before either. Competitive programming challenges me intellectually and gives me great passion during my first year at college.</p>

      <h3>🎬 Video Editing</h3>
