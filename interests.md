    <h2>About My Interests</h2>
    <div class="interest-description">
      <h3>🏀 Basketball</h3>
      <p>I enjoy playing basketball as it helps me stay active and develop teamwork skills. It teaches me about strategy, coordination, and the importance of practice and persistence. I once won the All-Star championship of the Freshman basketball game.</p>

    <div class="interest-description">
      <h3>⛵ Sailing</h3>
      <p>Sailing represents my love for adventure and the sea. It's a sport that requires patience, understanding of weather patterns, and the ability to work with natural elements. I once won the runner-up in the National Amateur Sailing Promotion Competition.</p>

    <div class="interest-description">
      <h3>🎵 Music</h3>
      <p>Music is my creative outlet and a way to relax. I appreciate various genres and find that music helps me focus during work and provides inspiration for my projects. I like singing as well. My favourite singers are Talor Swift and Ed Sheeran.</p>

    <div class="interest-description">
      <h3>💻 Coding Contest</h3>
      <p>Unlike most algorithm competition medalists, I have no OI experience in high school. Fortunately, I had two best like-minded teammates who also started from scratch. Together, we trained and grew. Programming contests like ICPC challenge me intellectually and ignite my passion throughout my college years.</p>

      <h3>🎬 Video Editing</h3>
      <p>Video editing enables me to express my creativity through visual storytelling. I enjoy blending footage, music, and especially visual effects to craft engaging content.
