      <p class="project-role">Main Contributor</p>
      <p class="project-description">
        Embodied-Reasoner is a multimodal model designed for deep reasoning and long-horizon interaction in embodied environments. It features a trajectory engine, multi-stage training, and robust evaluation benchmarks.<br>
        <strong>With OSPP funding, I contributed to resolving two key navigation bottlenecks</strong>—ambiguity in identical object instances and imprecise targeting of large objects—by integrating 3D pose estimation, semantic region labeling, and dialogue-based disambiguation. These solutions significantly improved spatial accuracy and interaction robustness.

      <h2 class="project-title">The Application of Reinforcement Learning for Agents in Automated Bidding Scenarios</h2>
      <p class="project-role">Leader</p>
      <p class="project-description">
        This project explores strategic bidding in large-scale ad auctions using reinforcement learning. In a simplified simulator, we designed multiple agent types—truthful, conservative, aggressive, and adaptive—under Generalized Second-Price rules with budget and value uncertainties. Our main goal was to train RL-based bidding agents to maximize cumulative profit and ROI in uncertain and competitive environments. The project also integrates advanced reward shaping and lays the foundation for transferring to large-scale real-world auction simulators like the NeurIPS 2024 Auto-Bidding environment. As the team leader, I designed the full simulation framework and led the RL integration, analysis, and visualizations.

      <h2 class="project-title">RAGEN: Training Agents by Reinforcing Reasoning</h2>
      <p class="project-role">Contributor</p>
      <p class="project-description">
        RAGEN focuses on LLM reasoning agents, utilizing RL to operate effectively in interactive and stochastic environments. It addresses the challenges of extending RL beyond static, single-turn tasks by handling multi-turn interactions and environmental uncertainty.

      <h2 class="project-title">WeaveWave: Towards Multimodal Music Generation</h2>
      <p class="project-role">Main Contributor</p>
      <p class="project-description">
        WeaveWave explores multimodal music generation, aiming to create music from diverse inputs. It bridged existing MLLMs and Text-to-Music systems, proposing end-to-end architectures, and developing a unified generation framework with a custom training pipeline.
